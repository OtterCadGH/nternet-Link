# Ti GPT V2

## Coming Soon

This repository will host **Ti GPT V2**, a ground up redesign of the original Ti GPT project.

V2 focuses on cleaner hardware integration, more robust power and data handling, and a significantly improved software experience. The goal is to move from a proof of concept into something far more polished, repeatable, and usable.

## Demo Preview

A working demo already exists. You can watch it here:

Stay tuned!
